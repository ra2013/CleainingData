This codebook describe the processing of the data given in 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

The data mentioned above has two subsets. One is a training set and the other is a test set.
As first step, each set was processed by combining the subject list with the activity list with the main data into
one data frame. Later, only information about the variables that are mean or standard deviation were kept. All other
columns were dropped. A further step was to merge the training set and the testing set into one big set.
From this set, a new tidy data set was created that contains for each subjectId and activity the mean of each of the variable
in the data set. In this step, the columns names were updated and each original name such xx  was wrapped with mean[xx] to 
show that this is actually the mean of the measurements for this subject and activity.
The origial values of the measurements after this operation are still normalized and lies between -1 to 1.

The list of columns is the following and their meaning is according to the description in the original dataset.

"1" "subjectID"
